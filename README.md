# LearnRussian

A simple Chrome extension to help me extend my Russian vocabulary. The extension swaps English nouns on a webpage with their Russian equivalents. Clicking the Extension popup buttons brings up a dictionary with all the relevants words on the current page.

## In the Chrome Store
[Chrome Web Store: ЛЕКСИКА! - Russian Vocabulary Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0-russian-vocabular/nhkfellofhhgdjhhlpmjpfkakobinldf)

## Possible future development

* ~~Ability to blacklist websites or temporarily disable the extension would be really useful.~~

* ~~Deal with multiple English words getting flattened into a single Russian word (e.g. head/mind/brains -> голова)~~

* ~~Maintain capitalization after translation.~~

* Some way of automatically extending the available dictionary - perhaps allowing the user to do so. Blacklisting/removing words also requested.

* ~~Show the gender of words in the Reference dictionary. This information already exists in dictionary.txt.~~

* ~~Right-click to see translation, for quicker help than checking the dictionary.~~

* Very easily altered to support other languages - simply edit dictionary.js.

* Click in dictionary to get more info, e.g. get a pronunciation audio clip, word conjugations, etc.

* Click in dictionary to highlight words on page / click on page to highlight in dictionary

* POS-tagging to identify nouns and not incorrectly translate verbs.

* Other browsers? Probably more effort than it's worth considering Chrome popularity.

* ~~Limit number of words translated per page (requested).~~
